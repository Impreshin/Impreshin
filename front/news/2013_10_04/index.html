				<p>A lot of work has gone into the capture form to make it simple but effective</p>
				<p>We have added an admin definable list of resources for the writers to make use of, either web links or uploaded files as well as a set of tools the proof reader and author can make use of</p>

				<p>Layout is handled the same way as AdBooker, drag the bookings from the right hand list onto the page. What could possibly be simpler?</p>
