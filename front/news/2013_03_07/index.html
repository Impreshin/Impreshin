<h1>Placing, Colours and Sub Placing</h1>

<p>The placing section got a bit of a makeover recently. Sub placings can be added.</p>
<p>There is an option to force a colour now, this is usefull if you still make use of different colour tarrifs for the various placing sections. if there is no forced colour then the user will be provided with a drop down when capturing a booking to select which colour is available. <br />
</p>
<p>Should your publication only use full colour it would be advisable to just set all your placing / sub placing as &quot;Full Colour&quot; as to limit confusion</p>
