<h1>Full page Archives</h1>
<p>We have added a "Pages" application to the mix </p>
		
<p>Simply click on the application switcher and go to the Pages application to jump there (if you have access to the application). Full page PDF's can be uploaded from one of 3 places. 

</p>
<ul>
	<li>AdBooker's Production Page (<a href="/news/2014_08_08">see here</a>)</li>
	<li>NewsFiler's Production Page (<a href="/news/2014_08_08">see here</a>)</li>
	<li>Pages application</li>
</ul>	
		
		<p>Please note that you have to be given access to the application first</p>

		<p>Clicking on any of the pages shows the following:</p>
<img src="/front/news/2014_08_13/page.jpg" width="600" height="464" class="img border" style="width: 600px; height: 464px"/>
		<p>The idea with the pages app is to prehaps give your printer access to the application and they can download the page's PDF directly. So no more messing around with ftps that keep timing out or emails that just don't send</p>
		<p>
			Upload and download are controlled with a permission in the settings menu
